      <h1>
        Hey! I'm Charlane Yu, a professional makeup artist from Singapore
        currently based in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.
      </h1>

      <p>
        People say, "do what you love and you will never have to work again."
        I'd always felt that that was unrealistic until I finally became a
        makeup artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having been raised in a traditional family, I was expected to do well in
        school, and I worked very hard to meet that expectation. I made my
        parents really happy when I presented to them my job offer from NUS as a
        researcher. I had made it! During my spare time, though, I was dolling
        up friends for their special events and occasionally some of them would
        joke about how I should consider switching careers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In late 2015, I finally took the plunge. I started my journey to
        becoming a full-time professional bridal makeup artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like working with brides because every wedding is magical in its
        unique way, and I love experiencing that. It is always an honour to be
        part of something so important.
      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer clean and light makeup with careful attention to details on eye
        adjustment and enhancement to bring out the beauty of each bride. I want
        romance to show through the bridal hairstyles that I create. Every
        hairdo is unique in its own way as I cater to each bride's style and
        preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy chatting with and listening to my brides to understand their
        unique needs. I do this before and during our makeup session. I believe
        alignment between you and me is crucial, in terms of what looks you
        prefer and whether you have any special requests, to creating great
        makeup and hairstyling.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm constantly improving my professional skills and knowledge through
        courses and experience in the field so you can trust to always be
        getting my best work yet!
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for reading and considering my service.&nbsp;I give my
        sincerest blessings to you on your big day!
